# Rating-System-PHP

A dynamic star‑rating system built while learning PHP, jQuery, and AJAX. This project allows users to rate posts in real time, update their ratings, and instantly view the average rating without reloading the page. I learned how to use AJAX for seamless data updates, manage user sessions, store ratings in a MySQL database, and build interactive UI components using jQuery plugins. This project strengthened my understanding of front‑end and back‑end communication, JSON responses, and creating smooth, user‑friendly features in PHP applications.
